# More about me
Hi, I'm a young programmer from Poland.
Programming is my passion. I'm mainly focused on making tools, websites and games.
I speak Polish (my native language), fluent English and basic German.
I'm a big fan of Linux and open source, I use a free lightweight operating system Arch Linux.
Personally I'm an introvert and I enjoy being alone, but I have a strong extroverted side and still like being around people and joking a lot.
